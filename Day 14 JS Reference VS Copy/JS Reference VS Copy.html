    // You might think we can just do something like this:
    console.log(players,team);
    // however what happens when we update that array?
    //team[3]="Lux"
    // now here is the problem!

    // oh no - we have edited the original array too!

    // Why? It's because that is an array reference, not an array copy. They both point to the same array!

    // So, how do we fix this? We take a copy instead!
    const team2 = players.slice();
    // one day

    // or create a new array and concat the old one in
    const team3 = [].concat(players);
    // or use the new ES6 Spread
    const team4 = [...players];
    team4[3] = "LoLa";
    console.log(team4);
    // now when we update it, the original one isn't changed

    // with Objects
    const person = {

    // how do we take a copy instead?

    console.log(cap2);
    // We will hopefully soon see the object ...spread
    //const cap3={...person};
    // Things to note - this is only 1 level deep - both for Arrays and Objects. lodash has a cloneDeep method, but you should think twice before using it.
